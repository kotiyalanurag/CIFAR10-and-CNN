# CIFAR10
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
But in this project we will only be using a subset of the original data so we will have 15,000 images in training data and 3,000 images in testing data.
